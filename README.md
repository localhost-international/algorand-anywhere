# Algorand Anywhere
> (Eventually) A light Algorand SDK for JavaScript, TypeScript and Deno applications. 

### What?

An Algorand/AVM SDK you can use... "anywhere" there's JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Why?

The official `js-algorand-sdk` has yet to fully support React Native (although [there is an active/on-going effort to land support for React Native in v3](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/issues/779)). 

As were building a mobile wallet using Expo EAS, figured we could:

[x] Hack together an API with Swagger
[ ] Create a light, Expo/React Native friendly SDK (10%)
[ ] Learn more about the AVM (30%)

## When?
